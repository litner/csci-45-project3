## Rules ##
<p>The specific rules for this project are:</p>
1. Use two transistors
2. Make use of automation in some fashion (a drone, a robot, a sentry gun to shoot water at coots, etc.)
3. Use a servo motor or stepper motor
4. Have some form of remote access to the project to get it to start, or to control it. Making web access would work, too.
5. Make noise of some sort or include a meme of some sort.

# Project Proposal #
<p>motion tracking water spraying cannon using a servo to change the direction of the output and somehow fitting two transistors in there. we also use an ir remote control to cycle through different settings.</p>
